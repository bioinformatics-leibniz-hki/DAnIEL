  abstract               = {Compositional data consist of vectors of proportions normalized to a constant sum from a basis of unobserved counts. The sum constraint makes inference on correlations between unconstrained features challenging due to the information loss from normalization. However, such correlations are of long-standing interest in fields including ecology. We propose a novel Bayesian framework (BAnOCC: Bayesian Analysis of Compositional Covariance) to estimate a sparse precision matrix through a LASSO prior. The resulting posterior, generated by MCMC sampling, allows uncertainty quantification of any function of the precision matrix, including the correlation matrix. We also use a first-order Taylor expansion to approximate the transformation from the unobserved counts to the composition in order to investigate what characteristics of the unobserved counts can make the correlations more or less difficult to infer. On simulated datasets, we show that BAnOCC infers the true network as well as previous methods while offering the advantage of posterior inference. Larger and more realistic simulated datasets further showed that BAnOCC performs well as measured by type I and type II error rates. Finally, we apply BAnOCC to a microbial ecology dataset from the Human Microbiome Project, which in addition to reproducing established ecological results revealed unique, competition-based roles for Proteobacteria in multiple distinct habitats.},

  abstract               = {High-throughput sequencing based techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, have the potential to elucidate the complex inner workings of natural microbial communities - be they from the world's oceans or the human gut. A key step in exploring such data is the identification of dependencies between members of these communities, which is commonly achieved by correlation analysis. However, it has been known since the days of Karl Pearson that the analysis of the type of data generated by such techniques (referred to as compositional data) can produce unreliable results since the observed data take the form of relative fractions of genes or species, rather than their absolute abundances. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, we show that such compositional effects can be widespread and severe: in some real data sets many of the correlations among taxa can be artifactual, and true correlations may even appear with opposite sign. Additionally, we show that community diversity is the key factor that modulates the acuteness of such compositional effects, and develop a new approach, called SparCC (available at https://bitbucket.org/yonatanf/sparcc), which is capable of estimating correlation values from compositional data. To illustrate a potential application of SparCC, we infer a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. Using the SparCC network as a reference, we estimated that the standard approach yields 3 spurious species-species interactions for each true interaction and misses 60% of the true interactions in the human microbiome data, and, as predicted, most of the erroneous links are found in the samples with the lowest diversity.},

We have developed Trimmomatic as a more flexible and efficient preprocessing tool, which could correctly handle paired-end data. RESULTS: The value of NGS read preprocessing is demonstrated for both reference-based and reference-free tasks. Trimmomatic is shown to produce output that is at least competitive with, and in many cases superior to, that produced by other tools, in all scenarios tested.

It targets the formal fungal barcode-the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region-and offers all approximately 1 000 000 public fungal ITS sequences for reference. These are clustered into approximately 459 000 species hypotheses and assigned digital object identifiers (DOIs) to promote unambiguous reference across studies. In- house and web-based third-party sequence curation and annotation have resulted in more than 275 000 improvements to the data over the past 15 years. UNITE serves as a data provider for a range of metabarcoding software pipelines and regularly exchanges data with all major fungal sequence databases and other community resources. Recent improvements include redesigned handling of unclassifiable species hypotheses, integration with the taxonomic backbone of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and support for an unlimited number of parallel taxonomic classification systems.},

Inference of interaction networks from sparse and compositional data requires specialized statistical approaches. A popular solution is SparCC, however its performance limits the calculation of interaction networks for very high-dimensional datasets. Here we introduce FastSpar, an efficient and parallelizable implementation of the SparCC algorithm which rapidly infers correlation networks and calculates P-values using an unbiased estimator. We further demonstrate that FastSpar reduces network inference wall time by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to SparCC. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: FastSpar source code, precompiled binaries and platform packages are freely available on GitHub: github.com/scwatts/FastSpar. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: Most studies describing the human gut microbiome in healthy and diseased states have emphasized the bacterial component, but the fungal microbiome (i.e., the mycobiome) is beginning to gain recognition as a fundamental part of our microbiome. To date, human gut mycobiome studies have primarily been disease centric or in small cohorts of healthy individuals. To contribute to existing knowledge of the human mycobiome, we investigated the gut mycobiome of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) cohort by sequencing the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) region as well as the 18S rRNA gene. RESULTS: Three hundred seventeen HMP stool samples were analyzed by ITS2 sequencing. Fecal fungal diversity was significantly lower in comparison to bacterial diversity. Yeast dominated the samples, comprising eight of the top 15 most abundant genera. Specifically, fungal communities were characterized by a high prevalence of Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and Candida, with S. cerevisiae, M. restricta, and C. albicans operational taxonomic units (OTUs) present in 96.8, 88.3, and 80.8% of samples, respectively. There was a high degree of inter- and intra-volunteer variability in fungal communities. However, S. cerevisiae, M. restricta, and C. albicans OTUs were found in 92.2, 78.3, and 63.6% of volunteers, respectively, in all samples donated over an approximately 1-year period. Metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data agreed with ITS2 results; however, ITS2 sequencing provided greater resolution of the relatively low abundance mycobiome constituents. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to bacterial communities, the human gut mycobiome is low in diversity and dominated by yeast including Saccharomyces, Malassezia, and Candida. Both inter- and intra- volunteer variability in the HMP cohort were high, revealing that unlike bacterial communities, an individual's mycobiome is no more similar to itself over time than to another person's. Nonetheless, several fungal species persisted across a majority of samples, evidence that a core gut mycobiome may exist. ITS2 sequencing data provided greater resolution of the mycobiome membership compared to metagenomic and 18S rRNA gene sequencing data, suggesting that it is a more sensitive method for studying the mycobiome of stool samples.},

It is the varied metabolic contributions of these numerous non-Saccharomyces species that are thought to impart complexity and desirable taste and aroma attributes to wild ferments in comparison to their inoculated counterparts. To map the microflora of spontaneous fermentation, metagenomic techniques were employed to characterize and monitor the progression of fungal species in 5 different wild fermentations. Both amplicon-based ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) phylotyping and shotgun metagenomics were used to assess community structure across different stages of fermentation. While providing a sensitive and highly accurate means of characterizing the wine microbiome, the shotgun metagenomic data also uncovered a significant overabundance bias in the ITS phylotyping abundance estimations for the common non-Saccharomyces wine yeast genus Metschnikowia. By identifying biases such as that observed for Metschnikowia, abundance measurements from future ITS phylotyping datasets can be corrected to provide more accurate species representation. Ultimately, as more shotgun metagenomic and single-strain de novo assemblies for key wine species become available, the accuracy of both ITS-amplicon and shotgun studies will greatly increase, providing a powerful methodology for deciphering the influence of the microbial community on the wine flavor and aroma.},

Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis. RESULTS: We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing has led to increased insights into the human skin microbiome. Currently, the majority of skin microbiome investigations are limited to characterizing prokaryotic communities, and our understanding of the skin fungal community (mycobiome) is limited, more so for cohorts outside of the western hemisphere. Here, the skin mycobiome across healthy Chinese individuals in Hong Kong are characterized. RESULTS: Based on a curated fungal reference database designed for skin mycobiome analyses, previously documented common skin colonizers are also abundant and prevalent in this cohort. However, genera associated with local terrains, food, and medicine are also detected. Fungal community composition shows interpersonal (Bray-Curtis ANOSIM = 0.398) and household (Bray-Curtis ANOSIM = 0.134) clustering. Roles of gender and age on diversity analyses are test- and site- specific, and, contrary to bacteria, the effect of household on fungal community composition dissimilarity between samples is insignificant. Site-specific, cross-domain positive and negative correlations at both community and operational taxonomic unit levels may uncover potential relationships between fungi and bacteria on skin. CONCLUSIONS: The studied Chinese population presents similar major fungal skin colonizers that are also common in western populations, but local outdoor environments and lifestyles may also contribute to mycobiomes of specific cohorts. Cohabitation plays an insignificant role in shaping mycobiome differences between individuals in this cohort. Increased understanding of fungal communities of non-western cohorts will contribute to understanding the size of the global skin pan-mycobiome, which will ultimately help understand relationships between environmental exposures, microbial populations, and the health of global humans.},

  abstract               = {BACKGROUND: the analysis of microbial communities through dna sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. RESULTS: Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast UniFrac, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. CONCLUSIONS: The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both GitHub and Bioconductor.},

  abstract               = {Surfaces within the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), especially those handled frequently by hospital staff, provide sources of gut-colonizing bacteria for hospitalized infants, in addition to those acquired perinatally from maternal sources such as breastmilk. In comparison to bacteria, very little is known about potential sources of colonizing fungi in the NICU setting. Thus, the objective of this study was to characterize fungal communities (mycobiomes) of potential colonization sources for neonates hospitalized in a large university NICU. We hypothesized that the unit surfaces would contain different mycobiomes than those of human-associated (breastmilk) sources. We characterized mycobiomes of NICU surfaces of multiple individual patient care areas as well as those of breastmilk samples by sequencing the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2) of the fungal rDNA locus. We found that, across all samples, Candida and Saccharomyces species were the most prevalent taxa and had the greatest relative abundances. Breastmilk samples had significantly higher fungal alpha-diversities than NICU surface samples and fungal community compositions (beta diversities) differed significantly between the two sample types. Mycobiome compositions were predominantly driven by the relative abundances of three fungal taxa: Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In total, 21 individual fungal taxa showed significantly greater relative abundances in breastmilk as compared to NICU surfaces, with three being of particular interest to human health: Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Since no fungal DNA was detected when whole breastmilk was used as the DNA template, as opposed to breastmilk subjected to cell lysis during the DNA isolation procedure, our results indicate that DNA is from fungal cells and is not cell-free DNA. In summary, both NICU surfaces and human breastmilk harbor distinct fungal communities that could provide a source of fungi for the developing infant gut mycobiota. In particular, Candida and Saccharomyces species are abundant and prevalent for both of these potential sources that infants are exposed to.},
